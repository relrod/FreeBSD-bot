In the future here's some ideas that I'd like to implement:
	- More optional modules, preferably that can be enabled/disabled while running.
		Some of these might include:
			- Factoids (using sqlite3).
			!- Level System (simple).
			- base-command finder (info TBA...almost done with this anyway).
			- misc (would include some random/fun commands..this is not a priority).
         - man pages module. This had existed but used an ugly database.
           I'd like to find an online manpage API and use this.
         - Port searching.
	- Optional new port notifications (of new committed ports) in a channel.

*  !- means done.
