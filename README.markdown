FreeBSD - Bot
=============

The unofficial FreeBSD IRC Information Bot.

How To Use
----------
    <GuestUser> What's a good CLI IRC Client, in the ports tree?
    <CodeBlock> Check out <irc/irssi>.
      <FreeBSD> irc/irssi (irc) -> A modular IRC client with many features : Maintainer: vanilla@FreeBSD.org

Requirements
------------
The bot uses Bot::BasicBot. On FreeBSD you can get this from ports. It also uses HTML::TableExtract, and LWP::Simple. You will also need the DBD::SQLite module for the factoids commands.

License
-------
What would a FreeBSD bot be without being released under the good 'ol BSD License.

I Wanna Contribute
------------------
Aside from forking a new bot, I'll accept patches for things. Please make them with diff -ruN, and test them before sending them. No guarantee is to be made that a patch will be implemented and it is by my discretion.

I need help!
